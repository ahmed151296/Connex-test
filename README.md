The task is to build a simple API, and frontend
application for displaying the data returned by the API.

## Installation and running application

installing node: $ brew install node in terminal

Verify node installed by typing below command:

$ node -v
$ npm -v

$ npm install express

installing ajv library in terminal:
$ npm install ajv

installing the promtclient library in terminal:

## What I would do if I had more time.

I would use Jest for unit testing things such as the endpoints and what they returned, the authorisation and if it returns 403 if the correct code isnt used. 

I would also use axios library for the autorisation to simplify the process. 

Also would of made the the background colors more dynamic when the screen size changes with media queries.
